in state compare and country compare, 
i want to introduce a feature that keeps track of the highest score leaderboard 
there is no log in so there are no names to associate with the leaderboard yet 
the main motivation is to introduce the concept of services and repositories 
and to use them with a simple and straightforward sqlite file database.
